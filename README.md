# Django Template App

This is a django template with poetry as dependency manager, django-restframework

## To run locally

Setup the .env credentials file by copying the .env.example file to .env and filling in the values (the defaults are probably correct if you haven't changes anything).

If docker-compose is installed, `docker-compose -f .postgres/postgres-docker-compose.yml up -d` can be run to have an instance of postgres up and running.

## To run with docker
Replace Docker file with DockerfileDev, and run docker-compose up


## Using poetry to install dependencies
Run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` to save the virtual python enviroment
Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies
If using VsCode, now is the time to select the interpreter from the .venv folder generated by poetry

## With the activated environment
`python manage.py migrate` to run migrations
`python manage.py runserver` to run the server

## Without the activated environment
`poetry run manage.py migrate` to run migrations
`poetry run manage.py runserver` to run the server
